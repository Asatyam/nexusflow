## It Destroys Parallelism 
   A workflow is a graph, not a list. The primary benefit of a DAG is to run independent tasks simultaneously.

Consider this workflow: Task A is the parent of B, C, and D.

A Topological Sort might produce this linear plan: A -> B -> C -> D. This plan is technically correct, but it's incredibly inefficient. It forces the system to wait for B to finish before starting C, and C to finish before starting D.

Our Event-Driven Reality: As soon as Task A completes, our system can and should schedule B, C, and D to run all at the same time.

Forcing the workflow into a single, linear sequence throws away the most significant performance benefit of using a graph in the first place.

## It Cannot Handle Dynamic or Conditional Logic
   Real-world workflows are not always static. A task's outcome might determine what happens next.

Example: A task named "Check-Inventory" could have two possible outcomes: "In-Stock" or "Out-of-Stock". If the item is in stock, the next task should be "Ship-Order". If not, the next task should be "Send-Backorder-Email".

A pre-calculated linear plan created by a topological sort cannot represent this if/else logic. It can only produce one static path.

Our event-driven model handles this perfectly. The "Check-Inventory" task would simply publish a different event based on its outcome (e.g., ShipOrderEvent or SendEmailEvent), and the orchestrator would react accordingly.

##  It's a Less Resilient Model
   A linear plan is brittle. If one task in the sequence fails, the entire plan is stalled.

In a linear plan, if task #5 out of 100 fails, the remaining 95 tasks cannot run, even if they are on completely independent branches of the original graph.

In our event-driven model, a task failure is just another event. When the TaskResultListener receives a TaskFailedEvent, it can intelligently decide to fail only that specific branch of the workflow, allowing other parallel branches to continue unaffected.
