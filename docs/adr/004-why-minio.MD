# Decision Record: Why MinIO?

- Easy to run locally
- S3 compatible
- No cost
- Open source

## Alternatives
- AWS S3: Costly for local development, requires internet access, not open source.
- Google Cloud Storage: Similar issues as AWS S3.
- Azure Blob Storage: Same issues as AWS S3.
- Ceph Object Storage: More complex setup, not as easy to run locally.
